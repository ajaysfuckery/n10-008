# Introduction to Networks 
<hr>
##### What is a Network?
- 2 or more connected computers that can share resources such as Data & Applications, Office Machines an Internet Connection or some combination of these as shown in figure 1.1

**Explanation of Figure 1.1**
*Figure 1.1 shows a really basic network made up of only 2 computers connected; they share resources such as files and even a printer hooked up to one of the hosts. These 2 hosts "talk" to each other using a computer langauge called binary code. Binary code is a collection of 1s and 0s in a specific order, that describes exactly what the hosts want to "say".*

##### The Local Area Network (LAN)
<hr>
- A Local Area Network is usually restricted to spanning a certain geographic location such as; an office building, a single department within a corporate office or a home office
- In the past, you couldn't put more than 30 workstations on a LAN and you had to cope with strict limitations on how far those machines could be from each other
- Because of technological advances, we are no longer limited by a LANs size and the distance a LAN can span.
- It is best practice to split a big LAN into smaller zones known as workgroups to make administration easier

##### Note:
**The meaning of workgroup in this context is slightly different than when the term is used in contrast to domains. In this context a workgroup is a set of devices with no security assosciation with one another. In a domain they do have a security asssociation. In this context, they are in the same network segment.**

- In a business environment, it's a good idea to arrange your LANs work groups along department divisions. (Example: 1 workgroup for accounting, 1 for Sales and 1 more for Marketing.) Figure 1.2 shows 2 separate LANs, each as it's own workgroup.

### Include figure 1.2

- In the diagram there are 2 LANs labelled Sales and Marketing. These are LANs in their most basic form. 
- Any device that connects to the Marketing LAN can access the resources of the Marketing LAN -> In this case the servers and the printers.

**There are 2 problems with this:**
- You must be physically connected to a workgroups LAN to get resources from it.
- You can't get from one LAN to the other and use the server data or printing resources remotely.

*This a typical issue that is resolved by using a router to connect the 2 LANs shown in Figure 1.3*
