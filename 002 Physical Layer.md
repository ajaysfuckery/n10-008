# The Physical Layer
<hr>
- Responsible for transmission of digital data bits
	- From the source device to the destination device over physical network communications media

<hr>
#### Hardware Specifications
- Cables
- Connectors
- NICs (Network interface Cards)
- Repeaters (For if the signal gets weak)
- Hubs (Allow you to connect multiple computers together)

<hr>
#### Encoding & Signaling
- Transforms data from bits (0s and 1s) into signals
- Signals are then sent over the network

<hr>
#### Functions
- Data Transmission
- Topology and Physical Network Design

<hr>
#### Bit rate control
