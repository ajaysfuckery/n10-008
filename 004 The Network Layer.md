# The Network Layer
<hr>
- Network Layer accepts dtaa from the Transport Layer.
- Network Layer passes data to the Data Link Layer

<hr>
#### Functions
- Packet Addressing
- Address conversion -> Conversion of physical address to a Logical Address
- A Logical address can be assigned to any device and it can be changed
- Source-to-Destination delivery
- Routing

<hr>
#### Routing
- The process of connecting Independant Networks together to create larger networks
-  Independant Networks connected to each other
- Determines the best path from source to destination
- Pass data from router to router among connected networks

<hr>
#### Internetworking
- Providing internetworking between networks
	- Provides logical connections between different types of networks
- Combine various networks to form a larger network

<hr>
#### Logical Addressing
- Defines addressing scheme
- Combine any number of networks 

<hr>
#### Packetizing
- Creates packets upon receiving data from upper layers
- Packets are created by emcapsulation
- Internet Protocol (IP) applies addresses to each packet

<hr>
#### Fragmentation
- Dividing lager packets into smaller fragments
	- Fragments can then be easily sent out on physical medium
