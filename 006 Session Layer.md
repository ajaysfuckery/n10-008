# Session Layer
<hr>
- Responsible for communication between 2 devices
	- Beginning of the session, maintenance and ending of a session
- Regulates the flow of information between 2 devices

<hr>
- Session protocol
	- Defines parameters for connections
- Manages the transfer of data
	- Who can transfer data
	- How long data can be transmitted

<hr>
#### Layer 5 Functions
- Session establishment, maintenance & termination
	- Enables 2 different machines to establish a session
- Session support 
	- Security
	- Name recognition
	- Login

<hr>
#### Dialog control
- Determines which device communicates first and how data will be sent
	- Types of Dialog control:
		- Simplex
		- Half Duplex
		- Full Duplex

	- Simplex means that you have 2 one way sessions, one device transmits while the other listens and then the devices switch (An example of this would be using walkie-talkies)
	
	- Half duplex means that traffic can be in both directions at the both time but each device takes it's turn

	- Full duplex means that traffic can be 2 way at the same time, so both devices can transmit data at the same time and data can be received at the same time.

<hr>
#### Protocols
- NetBIOS (Network Basic Input Output System)
- DNS (Domain Name Server)

- Both of these protocols deal with name recognition and name resoiution

- RPC (Remote Procedure Call)

- This is a client-server redirection method
- Requests are generated by clients but executed on severs

- NFS (Network File System)

- Allows client systems to access server based resources such as folders or files 

- The session layer is responsible for the overall flow of communication during the session
