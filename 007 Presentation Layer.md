# The Presentation Layer
<hr>
- Responsible for presenting data in a uniform format to the application
	- Masks any difference in data between 2 different systems
- Also referred to as the "translation layer"

<hr>
#### What does the presentation Layer do?
- Formats data that will be presented to the Application Layer
- Translates data into a common format known to the Application Layer at the receiving station

<hr>
#### Layer 6 Functions

##### Character Code Translation
- Character code translation -> Converting data into human understandable data (ASCII) {American Standard Code for Information Interchange} (EBCDIC) {Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code}
- These are 2 mechanisms to convert data into digital information

##### Data Conversion
- Bit Order -> Order by which the bits are received
- Carridge Return-Line Feed -> Taken from the days of type writers 
- Integer-floating point -> How precise a number needs to be (Integer = whole number & floating point number = decimal number)

<hr>
#### Data Compression
- Data compression reduces the number of bits transmitted across the network

<hr>
#### Data Encryption
- Data Encryption is used at the Presentation Layer
- Encryption is used for security purposes
