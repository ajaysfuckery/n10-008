# Mesh Topology
<hr>
#### Mesh Topology
- Unique Design, It is not very common in todays networks
- Each computer connects to all other computers with Point-to-Point (P2P) connection

<hr>
#### Mesh Topology Types
- You can have:
	- A partial mesh topology
	- A full mesh topology

- Partial mesh topology means that some systems are connected to other systems on the network, with redundant links
- Full mesh topology means that all systems are connected to each other, with multiple and redundant links

<hr>
#### Mesh Topology Advantages
- Expand network without user disruption
- Nodes have dedicated links
- Fault identification isolation
- Reduced chance of a network failure
- Multiple routes available for communication
- You can continue services even when parts of the network fail

<hr>
#### Mesh Topology Disadvantages
- The installation is complex
- More space required for dedicated links
- There are multiple network interfaces to maintain
- Expensive Implementation 
- Utilization is low

- When any 2 systems communicate they are using only one link at any given time, so all of the other links are not being used

- A mesh would not be used for every computer on a network but you might have some servers that perform important functions that must be linked together. This is when you would use a mesh topology
