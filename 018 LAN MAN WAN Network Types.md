# Area Network Types
<hr>
LAN -> Local Area Network
MAN -> Metropolitan Area Network
WAN -> Wide Area Network

<hr>
#### LAN
- Connects devices to allow sharing of data and resources
- Uses private addressing scheme
- Connected by Switches
- Very fast data transmission
- Easy design and maintainance

<hr>
#### MAN
- Covers area larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN
- Covers a regional geographic area
- They can be found in common organizations (EX. Hospitals, Military bases)
- Designed for high speed connectivity
- Harder to design and maintain

- They are less fault tolerant
- More network congestion could be apparent
- MANs are costly
- Moderate data transfer rate
- Moderate propagation delay

<hr>
#### WAN
- WANs cover large geographic areas
- They support high speed data transfers but they are not as fast as a LAN
- They are relatively expensive to create
- There are 2 types -> Switched WAN and point-to-point WAN
- Challenging to design and maintain

- WANs support high speed but are 1/10th the speed of a LAN
- Propagation delay is a challenge
- The data on a WAN can be transmitted by:
	- Optic Wires
	- Microwaves
	- Satellites

#### LAN vs. MAN vs. WAN
- LANs connect devices within an office or building
- MANs connect networks in or between cities
- WANs connect networks within a country or globally
