# Storage Area Network (SAN)
<hr>
- A SAN is a dedicated high speed network (but it is not like a LAN)
- A SAN allows network access to storage at the block-level
- Composed of devices connected with assorted technologies, protocols and topologies

1. Servers connect to the SAN to allocate storage
2. Clients on the standard LAN can access the servers
3. Servers access the SAN to gain access to the storage
